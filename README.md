Hackspace-Dashboard
===================
On our website you can get information about the open/closed state of the Hackspace.
You also can look up whether there is a person who can help you with your project.

In the Hackspace will be a RFID reader attached to a Rasperry Pi running a Python scrip that accesses a database and updates the status.
The content on the webpage is generated with the database.
